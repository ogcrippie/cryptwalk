## What can you do when you visit Cryptwalk?

Well, you can read articles. 

If you want to save an article, you can sign up and like an article. We collect your email and your like history. 

If you want to comment on an article, you need a github account. 

The like system and the comment system do not run on the same service which is why you need separate accounts.
